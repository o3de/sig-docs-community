# Open 3D Foundation D&C SIG Suggestion RFC Template

## :no_entry: If you submit a pull request to implement a process change without going through the RFC process, it may be closed with a polite request to submit an RFC first. :no_entry:

### When using this template, you do not have to fill out every question below. The questions are there for guidance.

This issue template should be used when filing an RFC related to _Documentation and Community processes and practice changes_ only. As a result, this RFC format should be used exclusively for discussions relating to SIG business which require extensive feedback from the community because it adds a new (or fundamentally changes an existing) process. Whether this process affects only the members of the SIG or all contributors, discussion is conducted in the open.

This RFC template should be used for any suggestion that is not based upon code or content related to the O3DE product itself. This template is for proposing new process models, approaches, or ideas to improve the O3DE community.

A hastily proposed RFC can hurt its chances of acceptance. Low-quality proposals, proposals for previously-rejected features, or those that don't fit into the near-term roadmap may be quickly rejected, demotivating the unprepared contributor. Laying some groundwork ahead of the RFC can make the process smoother.

Although there is no single way to prepare for submitting an RFC, it is generally a good idea to pursue feedback from other developers beforehand. Talking to the core team members will help you prepare for a successful RFC.

The most common preparations for writing and submitting an RFC include:

* Talking the idea over on our Discord server.
* Discussing the topic on our GitHub RFCs discussions page.
* Occasionally posting "pre-RFCs" on the GitHub RFCs discussion page.

You may file issues in the RFCs repo for discussion, but these are not actively looked at by the teams.

As a rule of thumb, receiving encouraging feedback from long-standing project developers, and particularly members of the relevant sub-team, is a good indication that the RFC is worth pursuing.
