name: SIG Reviewer/Maintainer Nomination Template
about: Nominate yourself or someone else to become a SIG reviewer or maintainer
title: 'SIG Reviewer/Maintainer Nomination'
---

The Documentation and Community SIG maintains several reviewer roles requiring SIG approval:

* **Documentation reviewer** - Documentation reviewers review for conformance with the [style guide](https://o3de.org/docs/contributing/to-docs/style-guide/), appropriateness of content, and other subjective factors to keep documentation content aligned.
* **Technical reviewer** - Technical reviewers review documentation for technical accuracy: They make sure that described steps, features, file formats, code examples, and other parts of documentation that are deeply technical match the _current_ product state.

Any individual can be a member of multiple reviewer or maintainer roles within this SIG!

For more on the general requirements of Reviewer and Maintainer roles, read our [Community Membership](https://github.com/o3de/community/blob/main/community-membership.md) information.
