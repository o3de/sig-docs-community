# Projects proposed for the SIG

During the early days of Open 3D Engine we'll be taking project pitches through the Wiki to find people interested in running or participating in certain medium- and long-term efforts to improve the documentation of O3DE (or access to it) and community outreach.

## How to propose a project

If you're planning to take long-term effort on something which affects the responsibilities of the D&C SIG according to its charter, you might want to propose a project so that at minimum, the SIG is aware that the work is happening (even if it's not "officially" approved.)

Add a row in the table below via a PR to propose a project! Any proposals submitted as wiki changes will be accepted onto this page as long as they:

* Align with the [SIG Charter](https://github.com/o3de/sig-docs-community/blob/main/governance/charter.md) in some way.
* Follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/o3de/community/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) in their description and intent.
* Fill in the **Project Name**, **Proposer**, and **Description** columns in their table row. If you're currently working on the project in some form (such as RFC or personal research) then please place a `:white_check_mark:` (:white_check_mark:) in the **In Progress** column.

## "Approved" projects

A project gets "official" approval at the discretion of the SIG, which means additional access to organizational and note-taking tools, and projects are required to regularly report on progress (and blockers) to drive behaviors and priorities for _other SIGs_ which block our committed projects. Approved projects are also eligible for a slot on any public roadmaps.

## Project list

Some notes:

* Only officially approved projects have an assigned owner.
