# O3DE Documentation & Community Special Interest Group

Welcome to the Documentation and Community Special Interest Group (D&C SIG) of Open 3D Foundation! 

We run the [o3de.org/docs](http://o3de.org/docs) website, manage its content, and work with the Open 3D Engine (O3DE) community to set standards and keep O3DE a collaborative, accepting environment for all. The SIG consists of a docs side and a community side who work closely together to provide learning content and community events. Just to name a few, this includes O3DE Documentation, video tutorials, blog posts, and live streams.

You can reach us at @sig-docs-community on Discord!

For a broader view of the whole O3DE community, go to the [o3de/community](https://github.com/o3de/community/) repo.

## D&C SIG Responsibilities
In summary, our responsibilities include:
- Maintaining the content of the O3DE Documentation in the official [O3DE website](https://www.o3de.org/)
- Supporting documentation requirements and publishing API references for core O3DE features, including Atom Renderer
- Official blogs, samples, demos, tutorials, and training
- Managing forums, Discord, and other community engagement channels

For more information, see the official [Documentation and Community SIG Charter](https://github.com/o3de/sig-docs-community/blob/main/governance/charter.md).

## How can you contribute? 

**Contribute to O3DE Documentation**

Whether it's filing an issue, updating existing docs, or even writing completely new docs - we highly appreciate all efforts to improving the documentation. 

If you're thinking of contributing to the docs, review [Contributing to O3DE Documentation](https://www.o3de.org/docs/contributing/to-docs/)  for onboarding instructions, style guides, and docs templates. 


**Write a blog post** 

If your team is working on an exciting project with O3DE or developing an awesome feature for the engine, then share the news in a blog post!
