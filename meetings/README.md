# Open 3D Engine Documentation & Community SIG Meetings

Each Open 3D Engine Special Interest Group (SIG) hosts a regular community meeting to update the community about the progress of the project and the SIG's contribution to the project. It is a recurring event to give everyone a chance to have their voice heard. The SIG holds its meetings monthly, and future meetings are held based on the [agendas on GitHub](https://github.com/o3de/sig-docs-community/labels/mtg-agenda).

O3DE cannot work without the help and input from as many of its community members as possible. *You do not need anyone's permission to get involved and contribute to the project.* The #sig-docs-community channel on [O3DE Discord](https://discord.gg/p3padwr58u) is a great place to begin getting involved. Many of our community members regularly share ideas, updates, and resources there. You can also find a number of topics under the [GitHub Discussions area](https://github.com/o3de/foundation/discussions) which need your input.

[Sign up on O3DE Mailing Lists](https://lists.o3de.org/groups) to get notifications for the recurring events.
